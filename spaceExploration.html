                <p class="coldWar-para">
                    The Cold War was a prolonged period of geopolitical and economic tension between the Capitalist United States and the former Communist Soviet Union that lasted from 1947 to 1991 due to conflicting political and economic ideals. George Keenan’s 1946 “The Long Telegram,” explaining how the Soviets and the U.S. will never reach a lasting agreement, left America to take action with containment, 
                    
                    a defense strategy that gave way to unprecedented scientific and technological innovation that spanned the next four decades. The goal of containment was to restrict communist expansion and to keep it within its already pre-existing boundaries. This caused incredible tension between the former allies because it encouraged each to one-up the other with greater military arsenals, 
                    
                    defense forces, and atomic bombs, thus starting the Arms Race. On 4th Oct 1957, a Soviet R-7 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile launched Sputnik 1, the world’s first artificial earth satellite into a low elliptical earth orbit.

                <p class="coldWar-para">
                    The launch of Sputnik 1 came as an unpleasant surprise to many Americans because space was perceived as the next logical chapter in the amazing American tale of exploration. 
                    
                    It was critical now more than ever for the United States not to lose too much ground to the Soviets, therefore taking the Cold War into space, thus creating the Space Race.
